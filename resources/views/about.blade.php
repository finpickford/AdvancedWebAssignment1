    <p>
      WristWatch was created in 2016. The creator, a fellow watch collector, found there wasn't a particular site available online for a collector to search for information quickly on a brand or model. </p>
      <p>Because of this, they created WristWatch. It is a site used to search and research watch brands and their models. Use it to check model names, model numbers, descriptions and price. </p>
      <p>By signing up to the site, you can add new brands or models of your choosing, leave comments, or even edit current models on the site.</p>
